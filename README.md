### FreeCAD file for the 3d prints for the Call-A-Robot device (1st gen, 2nd batch)
This is the FreeCAD file for the call-a-robot device.
All files can be printed without added supports, but some have to be rotated.
The models are seperated into four parts:
<ol>
  <li>the <b>battery mount</b> that lies at the bottom of the case</li>
  <li>the <b>display mount</b> which holds the display in place and sits on top of the battery</li>
  <li>the <b>raspberry pi mount</b> which connects with the battery mount</li>
  <li>the <b>sim hatmount</b> that is an extension to the display mount and holds the SIM7600 4G hat in place</li>
</ol>

Depending on the printer setting some fine tuning or post-processing may be necessary for a perfect fit.
The parts were printed in PLA, but other materials should work as well.
If printing in ABS, keep in mind that the material will shrink a bit.
All assembled parts are held in place by friction - no screws or glue is required.  

The case dimensions are 200 x 150 x 75.
The exact dimension depend on where you meassure - the case is slightly conic, with the top wider than the bottom.
The case of the 1st gen 1st batch has a slightly different size and the models are not compatible (but probably could be adjusted if need be)


The different parts are displayed below. Please note that <b>some models of the battery mount need to be printed twice</b>.

The asembled parts look like this:
